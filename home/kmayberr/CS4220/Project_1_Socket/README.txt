For our socket program, we have two C files, client.c and server.c
These need to be compiled with the commands:

gcc server.c -o server
gcc client.c -o client

They can then be run with:

./server and ./client

!!!!!****** THE SERVER MUST BE STARTED FIRST OR THE CLIENT WILL FAIL EVERYTIME ******!!!!!

For resources, we inspected the code in the book for a libraries import starting point. 
We then compiled notes from the assigned reading of what is a socket by IBM. 
From there we did some trial and error coding and consulted a youtube video that discussed some of the parts of C that are nuanced
about implementing a socket.

One big hurdle was reminding ourselves how to write code in C, as well as use blanca as writing code 
on blanca is terrible. 

NOTE: The code is under home/kmayberr/CS4220/Project_1_Socket/home/kmayberr/CS4220/Project_1_Socket

The directories got copied between my computer and the blanca server.
